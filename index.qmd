The second edition of the workshop INLA: Past, Present, and Future will be held in honour of Hävard Rue's 60th birthday. 

The event will take place **21-23 May 2025** in the University of Glasgow and is generously sponsored by the Glasgow Mathematical Journal Trust.

The workshop is free of charge, but registration is required due to limited capacity. Students and early career researchers are encouraged to participate.

We welcome contributed talks and poster presentations. The deadline for abstract submission is the **1st of March 2025**.
