Professor Lindgren's research focuses on spatial and spatio-temporal stochastic models, environmetrics, and computational methods and software. Among many others, he co-authored the influential paper "An Explicit Link Between Gaussian Fields and Gaussian Markov Random Fields: The Stochastic Partial Differential Equation Approach," published in the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series B. Professor Lindgren has contributed to the development of several R packages, including INLA for Bayesian latent Gaussian models and inlabru, a user-friendly interface for INLA with additional features.
