The Best Poster and Best Contributed Talk Awards recognise outstanding contributions to the conference. We are particularly committed to highlighting the achievements of early-career researchers, including PhD students and postdoctoral fellows.

Award winners will be announced on the final day of the conference. All submissions for contributed talks and posters by students and early-career researchers will automatically be considered for these awards.
