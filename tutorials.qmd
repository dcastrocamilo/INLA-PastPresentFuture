## Statistical modeling on networks using MetricGraph

**By** [David Bolin](https://www.kaust.edu.sa/en/study/faculty/david-bolin)

There is an increasing interest in geostatistical modeling on metric graphs, such as street or river networks. Motivated by this, the course provides an introduction to statistical modeling on metric graphs using the [MetricGraph](https://davidbolin.github.io/MetricGraph/) package in R. Participants will learn the fundamental concepts of metric graphs and how to build metric graphs from various real-world data sources, such as OpenStreetMap, SSN river data, and TomTom traffic data.

In addition to building and manipulating metric graphs, participants will learn how to add and integrate external data into metric graphs and explore data visualization techniques using ggplot2, plotly and leaflet. The course also introduces participants to mixed effects models and log-Gaussian Cox processes on metric graphs, including Gaussian random fields such as the Whittle-Matérn fields, and demonstrates how to fit these models using the MetricGraph package in combination with R-INLA and inlabru. 

**Packages needed**

MetricGraph, inlabru, INLA, leaflet, mapview, viridis, fmesher, sf, rSPDE


**About the instructor**: David Bolin is an Associate Professor of Statistics and Affiliate Professor of Applied Mathematics and Computational Sciences (AMCS) at KAUST. Before joining KAUST, he held positions at Chalmers University of Technology and the University of Gothenburg, where he earned the title of Docent in Mathematical Statistics. Bolin’s research focuses on stochastic partial differential equations (PDEs) and their applications in statistics, with an emphasis on developing computationally efficient tools for modeling non-stationary and non-Gaussian processes.

**About the instructor**: Professor Lindgren's research focuses on spatial and spatio-temporal stochastic models, environmetrics, and computational methods and software. Among many others, he co-authored the influential paper "An Explicit Link Between Gaussian Fields and Gaussian Markov Random Fields: The Stochastic Partial Differential Equation Approach," published in the Journal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series B. Professor Lindgren has contributed to the development of several R packages, including INLA for Bayesian latent Gaussian models and inlabru, a user-friendly interface for INLA with additional features.
